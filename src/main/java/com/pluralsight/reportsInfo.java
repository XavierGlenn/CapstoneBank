public void main() {

//R) Reports - A new screen that allows the user to run pre-defined reports or to run a custom search
//1) Month To Date
//2) Previous Month
//3) Year To Date
//4) Previous Year
//5) Search by Vendor - prompt the user for the vendor name and display all entries for that vendor
//0) Back - go back to the report page
//H) Home - go back to the home page

//Step 11: Implement Reports
//Task: Create a method to generate different types of reports (e.g., Month to Date, Year to Date).
//Hint: Use Java's LocalDate and ChronoUnit classes for date calculations.
//Consider: How will you filter transactions to include only those within a certain date range?
//Example Guidance: Think about how to create a method that accepts a date range and returns only transactions within that range.

// Filter transactions based on the selected report type.

// TODO: Display only the relevant transactions.
// TODO: Display matching transactions.

//Step 12: Search by Vendor
//Task: Write a method that allows users to search for transactions by vendor.
//Hint: Use a loop to find transactions that match the user's input for the vendor name. How can you make the search case-insensitive?
//Example Guidance: Think about using String methods that can help match user input to vendor names.

// Loop through transactions.
// Check if the vendor matches the input.
